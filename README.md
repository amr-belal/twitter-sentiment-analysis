## 📖 Overview

This project uses a labeled dataset of tweets to train a model capable of classifying text sentiment. It includes the full pipeline:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training with Logistic Regression
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

---

## ✨ Features

- Preprocessing for noisy Twitter data (removes hashtags, mentions, links, etc.)
- Multi-class classification: Positive, Negative, Neutral
- Train/test split and evaluation metrics
- Ready-to-use and extendable notebook format

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- NLTK / re (Regex)
